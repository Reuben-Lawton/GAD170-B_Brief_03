Brief 03 - Tank game

This is the repository for the Brief 03 - developing a Tank Game

Ideas so far

21/04/22

Within the map have a base to begin from 
 2 competing Tanks to start
- Tanks will have a basic health system
- Can pickup bonuses to increase health past 100%
- Speed boosts that allow for faster movements for a time period
- Additional pickups
	- add extra cannons
	- increased fire rate
	- shield (extra health)

Throughout the map there will be 
	- Additional targets to Destroy
	- A point system ( Thinking first Tank to score 3 Points wins the round)  - points awarded by destroying Targets or other Tanks
	- After 1st Round Targets will also be firing back 
		- When a Tank(either Tank) is in Range
		- Maybe the Targets destroyed in the first round will be part of either Team (depending on which Tank destroyed it initially)
		- Next rounds can then capture the Target's defences to be used next time 
		( Maybe after destroying, staying in the Target zone for X period to then 'capture & re-wire'
